   - Each service shows icon, name, and description
   - Hover over a service card to see the delete button

## Frontend-Backend Interaction

1. **Page Load**: 
   - Frontend loads index.html
   - JavaScript makes GET request to `/api/services`
   - Services are dynamically rendered in the grid

2. **Adding Service**:
   - User fills form and submits
   - JavaScript sends POST request with service data
   - Backend validates and adds service
   - Frontend receives response and reloads services
   - Success message displayed

3. **Deleting Service**:
   - User clicks delete button
   - JavaScript sends DELETE request to `/api/services/:id`
   - Backend removes service from array
   - Frontend reloads services to reflect changes
   - Success message displayed

## Deployment

### Development Deployment (Replit)
- Workflow automatically starts with `npm start`
- Server binds to 0.0.0.0:5000
- Static files served from root directory

### Production Deployment
- Configured for autoscale deployment (stateless)
- Uses `npm start` command
- Backend serves both API and static files
- No build step required

## Environment Variables
None required for basic operation. The app runs on PORT 5000 by default.

## Data Persistence
Currently uses in-memory storage. Services reset when server restarts. For persistence, consider adding:
- Database (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.)
- JSON file storage
- Redis for caching

## Security Considerations
- CORS enabled for all origins (restrict in production)
- No authentication/authorization (add if needed)
- Input validation on backend
- Frontend form validation
